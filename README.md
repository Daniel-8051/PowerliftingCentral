# PowerliftingCentral
My first Web Development project with design and implementation of both front-end and back-end technologies.
This project included the utilisation of various technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and REST API's along with the Bootstrap framework and JQuery library. All severside code (PHP) was required to be written from the ground up (without the use of frameworks). 

Design and implementation of functionality that communicated with a REST API along with using a dataset to show of various statistics in a graph format was the main aim of the website. CRUD operations can also be carried out by way of logging in with adminstrative credentials. 

Check out the end result below:
